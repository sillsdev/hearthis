	/// <summary>
	/// Class to compare two strings, one representing the "original" version of a text and the
	/// other representing the "new" version, and provide the results as a sequence of segments
	/// where the text of each segment is identified as an "Addition" to a "Deletion" from or the
	/// "Same" as the text of the other string. The number of segments computed is not guaranteed
	/// to be the same in both sets of results, but the number of "Same" segments will always be
	/// identical and their relative orders will correspond to each other. For example, comparing
	/// strings ABCXYZ and XYZABC would result in only one Same segment -- along with a Deletion
	/// from the old and an Addition to the new -- not two Same segments in inverted order.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>This is intended for relatively short text strings. Currently the algorithm limits
	/// the total number of segments to five, so for very large strings with lots of small
	/// differences, that might not be enough to pinpoint useful differences. If two strings
	/// are almost completely different, the current algorithm identifies even a single character
	/// as a matching (Same) segment. With the possible exception of very short strings in an
	/// ideographic script, this is probably not useful, so there is room for some enhancement. In
	/// practice, it is much less likely to be helpful to need the aid of a computer to find
	/// differences in very short strings.
	/// Note also that since this is a two-way diff, we have no knowledge of a common base version
	/// and cannot therefore say in any real historical sense whether a change was an addition or a
	/// deletion. 
	/// </remarks>
